# Cut
A mic-driven video displaying an ice sheet that trembles and shatters depending on the sound volume. Once shattered, it exposes a different reality, a world shaped by the impact of yelling.

## Installing
Download this repo, save the files in the data folder to your computer, make sure you have Processing with sound and video libraries installed and an available mic(external or built-in).

## Usage
Open the sketch in Processing, create a data folder next to it, place the .mp4, .png and .wav files into the data folder, and run the sketch. Try to break the ice with your voice.
